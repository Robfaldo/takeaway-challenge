# As a customer
# So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
# I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
# Hints on functionality to implement:

# Ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
# Place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
# The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
# Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
# Use the Gemfile to manage your gems
# Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
# However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
# Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account. I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.
